            "    Doctor: Okay, Mr. Sharma. Apart from the headache, any other symptoms? Nausea? Sensitivity to light?\n",
            "    Patient: Yes, bright light makes it much worse. I've also felt a bit nauseous, but I haven't thrown up.\n",
            "    Doctor: Any history of such headaches?\n",
            "    Patient: Not like this. I get tension headaches sometimes, but this feels different. I had my appendix removed about 10 years ago, but otherwise, I'm healthy. I do take Metformin for my Type 2 Diabetes.\n",

            "    Doctor: Okay. I'm going to check your blood pressure. *[pause]* It's a bit elevated at 140/90. Based on your symptoms - the one-sided pain, light sensitivity, and nausea - it's very likely a migraine. For now, I'm prescribing Tablet Sumatriptan 50mg, you can take one when a headache starts. I also want you to get a complete blood count test done, just to be sure. Please drink plenty of water and try to rest in a dark, quiet room. Follow up in one week.\n",
